Dependencies
------------
This plugin depends on the JMSPaymentCoreBundle_, so you'll need to add this to your kernel
as well even if you don't want to use its persistence capabilities.

Configuration
-------------

Additional informations
-------------
**API:**
The User API is not your main user account.
You have to create a new user account into Ogone Administration -> Users -> Create new user.
Into the creation form you have to select Admin profile and pick the box User "API".

**Design:**
All design data must be written with quotation marks

**Logo:**
According to the Ogone Technical Support, the logo must be located behind a https URL.
If you don't have https, you can store your logo into the Ogone Administration. Image hosting is an option so you need to activate it into Configuration -> Account -> Your options (You will find many hosting options depending on your image size). I recommend to contact sales support to know the cost of theses options (They are all available at 0â‚¬ only into test environment).

**UTF8:**
By default, Ogone uses ISO character encoding. However, it supports the usage of UTF-8, if the merchant calls the appropriate pages.
Also in ogone itself, Technical information/Global security parameters, you have to change the Character encoding to "UTF-8".
